# DEVOPS_GUIDELINE

**Devops_guidelin** it's a journey about create a real complete multiple microservice language (C# and GO communicatin with gRPC protocol ) application hosted on kind-kubernates cluster with Gitlab-CI/CD integration, image repo on dockerhub, Selfsigned certificates.
We are using tools like Kind, DockerDesktop, Gitlab, Dockerhub, Flux and many more.

It must be a learning journey **affordable for anyone** so everything must **run on a windows computer or using free tier of web service** like github o dockerhub

Storyline: Building a control panel of an industry. The control panel must have a web interface with authentication ( user and psw ).
By this panel a user can pilot different kind of machines and receives notification when the works are done.

# START THE JOURNEY #

**Capter1** : [Staring Up developing environment](/docs/Capter1.md)
Download and install VSCODE, configure C# environment and go environment

**Capter2** : [Gitlab on Docker](/docs/Capter2.md)
It's a tought procedure. Some complexity caused by selfsigned certificate
